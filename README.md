# Hello-world
New to github. September 2019

Hello you, 
Remember Luffy before Marineford battle, he is just a kid with immense potential but no focus. He only delivers 'naturally' only when there is no other way out. However, that is not enough to realize his dream. He trained 2 years under Rayleigh to focus his power and haki. Only releasing the required amounts, although having full control on his powers. 
This story should remind you something about you. Until now, you 'naturally' made your way to where you are. But, this is the point in your journey where you need to train yourself further to reach closer to realizing your dreams. Believe and train yourself. Be capable of producing whenever it is required. Instinct based reflexes can only carry you until this far. Train yourself and fly beyond these boundaries. Be happy...

There goes some pep talk to kick start Github..! - kvs11
